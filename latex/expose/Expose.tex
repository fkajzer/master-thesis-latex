\chapter{Related Work}

A key part of this thesis is to advance the area of visualisation of medical imaging.
Even though techniques exist, operations are still planned on two-dimensional images for three-dimensional surgical sites.
In 2009, Swennen et al. discuss several improvements for three-dimensional treatment planning over conventional methods \cite{swennen2009three}.
Cost reduction and better patient outcome were achieved with three-dimenstional treatment planning, even though the planning was still conducted on conventional computers with 2D screens.
Especially the diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment communication were improved.
Additionally, experts all over the world can be consulted since treatment plans can be send via electronic mail.
As VR technology advances and entry costs are reduced, VR is considered more and more for a wide spectrum of applications.
In surgery, the main focus of research is on surgical training with pre-modeled patient anatomy and pathology.
By using state-of-the-art medical imaging and virtual reality technology and head mounted displays, this thesis aims to advance medical visualisation and surgery planning for patient specific procedures.
In Section \ref{sec::RelatedWork1}, we will take a look at efforts made in creating a low cost surgical simulation to train novice surgeons.
The simulator aims to create pre-trained novices for cervical cancer surgery. 
Cervical cancer is one of the world's leading causes of death \cite{RN52}.
By developing low-cost systems and using commercially available technologies, costs can be reduced significantly over traditional training.
This is crucial for resource-challenged countries, where the main benefit of low cost VR surgery simulations is predicted.
In Section \ref{sec::RelatedWork2}, the OMFS specific training tool "VR Surgery" will be presented.
VR Surgery was developed as a visualisation aid for senior surgeons and as a practice tool for novices.

\chapter{Scope of the Thesis}

This chapter outlines the requirements of this thesis based on the challenges mentioned in Chapter 1.
It will also outline a broad monthly schedule of the thesis at the end.
As this thesis is part of a greater workflow, we will also clarify in which way the software components need to communicate and how it will be implemented.
