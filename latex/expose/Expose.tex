\chapter{Related Work}

A key part of this thesis is to advance the area of visualisation of medical imaging.
Even though techniques exist, operations are still planned on two-dimensional images of three-dimensional surgical sites.
Since 3D imaging is still an unconventional area, there does not exist much research in the oral and maxillofacial surgery. 
In \ref{sec::RelatedWork1}, we will take a look at efforts made in the area of three-dimensional treatment planning in orthognathic surgery.
Differences and possible advantages and disadvantages towards the conventional techniques will be thoroughly discussed.
%Furthermore, we will take a look at an approach to virtual reality sugery simulation in \ref{sec::RelatedWork2} to discuss requirements needed to achieve a good approval rate of the simulation for surgeons.
%Even though the goals of this work and this thesises differ, it gives great insight in the challenges involved
%in creating an immersive and realistic virtual reality simulation of surgeries.

\chapter{Scope of the Thesis}

This chapter outlines the requirements of this thesis based on the challenges mentioned in Chapter 1.
It will also outline a broad monthly schedule of the thesis at the end.
As this thesis is a cooperation between two endeveours we will also clarify in which way those applications need to communicate and how we are planning to achieve this.
