@article{Luca.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Over the past few years, a reorganization of the educational pathways has been promoted with the purpose of optimizing the acquisition of competences and their assessment, so as to reduce the risks to both health care professionals and end users. Virtual reality (VR) has been repeatedly tested, initially as a positive reinforcement for more traditional educational pathways and, more recently, as their potential substitute. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potentiality of VR simulation training in spine surgery.

METHODS

The VR simulator reproduced the lateral lumbar access to the spine. The simulation included a tutorial, the preoperative settings, and the surgical session with different levels of procedural complexity. A total of 10 users were recruited for this study: 3 senior surgeons (group A) and 7 orthopedic residents or junior orthopedic surgeons (group B). Each user completed the simulation twice.

RESULTS

The user's age or previous experience with VR technology did not show any relevance. On average, the entire simulation was completed in 24'36'. Group B showed an improvement between the 2 attempts in both sessions, the preoperative settings and the surgical simulation. The number of major errors dropped from an average of 5.2 to 1.8 and from an average of 4 (maximum 6-minimum 1) to 1.4, respectively. The simulation was never interrupted because of technical bugs or adverse effects related to the technology.

CONCLUSIONS

VR-based training pathways might promote a high standard of care. Our preliminary experience suggests an effective implementation of the traditional coaching process.},

@article{Kneebone.2003,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Surgical skills are required by a wide range of health care professionals. Tasks range from simple wound closure to highly complex diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Technical expertise, although essential, is only one component of a complex picture. By emphasising the importance of knowledge and attitudes, this article aims to locate the acquisition of surgical skills within a wider educational framework.

SIMULATORS

Simulators can provide safe, realistic learning environments for repeated practice, underpinned by feedback and objective metrics of performance. Using a simple classification of simulators into model-based, computer-based or hybrid, this paper summarises the current state of the art and describes recent technological developments. Advances in computing have led to the establishment of precision placement and simple manipulation simulators within health care education, while complex manipulation and integrated procedure simulators are still in the development phase.

EVALUATION

Tension often exists between the design and evaluation of surgical simulations. A lack of high quality published data is compounded by the difficulties of conducting longitudinal studies in such a fast-moving field. The implications of this tension are discussed.

THE WIDER CONTEXT

The emphasis is now shifting from the technology of simulation towards partnership with education and clinical practice. This highlights the need for an integrated learning framework, where knowledge can be acquired alongside technical skills and not in isolation from them. Recent work on situated learning underlines the potential for simulation to feed into and enrich everyday clinical practice.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

This review aims to provide a framework for evaluating the utility of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction intervention to alleviate pain and distress during medical procedures. We first describe the theoretical bases underlying the VR analgesic and anxiolytic effects and define the main factors contributing to its efficacy, which largely emerged from studies on healthy volunteers. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical trials using VR distraction during different medical procedures, such as burn injury treatments, chemotherapy, surgery, dental treatment, and other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

METHODS

A broad literature search was performed using as main terms {\textquotedbl}virtual reality,{\textquotedbl} {\textquotedbl}distraction,{\textquotedbl} and {\textquotedbl}pain.{\textquotedbl} No date limit was applied and all the retrieved studies on immersive VR distraction during medical procedures were selected.

RESULTS

VR has proven to be effective in reducing procedural pain, as almost invariably observed even in patients subjected to extremely painful procedures, such as patients with burn injuries undergoing wound care, and physical therapy. Moreover, VR seemed to decrease cancer-related symptoms in different settings, including during chemotherapy. Only mild and infrequent side effects were observed.

DISCUSSION

Despite these promising results, future long-term randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and evaluating not only self-report measures but also physiological variables are needed. Further studies are also required both to establish predictive factors to select patients who can benefit from VR distraction and to design hardware/software systems tailored to the specific needs of different patients and able to provide the greatest distraction at the lowest cost.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE

Virtual reality (VR) applications with head-mounted displays (HMDs) have had an impact on information and multimedia technologies. The current work aimed to describe the process of developing a highly immersive VR simulation for laparoscopic surgery.

METHODS

We combined a VR laparoscopy simulator (LapSim) and a VR-HMD to create a user-friendly VR simulation scenario. Continuous clinical feedback was an essential aspect of the development process. We created an artificial VR (AVR) scenario by integrating the simulator video output with VR game components of figures and equipment in an operating room. We also created a highly immersive VR surrounding (IVR) by integrating the simulator video output with a [Formula: see text] video of a standard laparoscopy scenario in the department's operating room.

RESULTS

Clinical feedback led to optimization of the visualization, synchronization, and resolution of the virtual operating rooms (in both the IVR and the AVR). Preliminary testing results revealed that individuals experienced a high degree of exhilaration and presence, with rare events of motion sickness. The technical performance showed no significant difference compared to that achieved with the standard LapSim.

CONCLUSION

Our results provided a proof of concept for the technical feasibility of an custom highly immersive VR-HMD setup. Future technical research is needed to improve the visualization, immersion, and capability of interacting within the virtual scenario.},

@article{Huber.2017,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) and head mount displays (HMDs) have been advanced for multimedia and information technologies but have scarcely been used in surgical training. Motion sickness and individual psychological changes have been associated with VR. The goal was to observe first experiences and performance scores using a new combined highly immersive virtual reality (IVR) laparoscopy setup.

METHODS

During the study, 10 members of the surgical department performed three tasks (fine dissection, peg transfer, and cholecystectomy) on a VR simulator. We then combined a VR HMD with the VR laparoscopic simulator and displayed the simulation on a 360° video of a laparoscopic operation to create an IVR laparoscopic simulation. The tasks were then repeated. Validated questionnaires on immersion and motion sickness were used for the study.

RESULTS

Participants' times for fine dissection were significantly longer during the IVR session (regular: 86.51~s [62.57~s; 119.62 s] vs. IVR: 112.35~s [82.08~s; 179.40 s]; p = 0.022). The cholecystectomy task had higher error rates during IVR. Motion sickness did not occur at any time for any participant. Participants experienced a high level of exhilaration, rarely thought about others in the room, and had a high impression of presence in the generated IVR world.

CONCLUSION

This is the first clinical and technical feasibility study using the full IVR laparoscopy setup combined with the latest laparoscopic simulator in a 360° surrounding. Participants were exhilarated by the high level of immersion. The setup enables a completely new generation of surgical training.},

To review the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, with a focus on current uses in surgical training, surgical planning, clinical outcomes, and biomedical research. To evaluate the limitations and future implications of 3D printing in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.

RECENT FINDINGS

Studies reviewed demonstrated 3D printing applications in surgical planning including accurate anatomic biomodels, surgical cutting guides in reconstruction, and patient-specific implants fabrication. 3D printing technology also offers access to well tolerated, reproducible, and high-fidelity/patient-specific models for surgical training. Emerging research in 3D biomaterial printing have led to the development of biocompatible scaffolds with potential for tissue regeneration in reconstruction cases involving significant tissue absence or loss. Major limitations of utilizing 3D printing technology include time and cost, which may be offset by decreased operating times and collaboration between departments to diffuse in-house printing costs SUMMARY: The current state of the literature shows promising results, but has not yet been validated by large studies or randomized controlled trials. Ultimately, further research and advancements in 3D printing technology should be supported as there is potential to improve resident training, patient care, and surgical outcomes.},

The mentor gave the resident guidance via Skype and HoloLens, communicating by voice, and video of the surgical field, and providing reference data.

RESULTS

There was no delay in voice communication and a delay of {\textless}0.5 seconds in the video. The resident was able to confirm the main landmarks of the surgical field and to grasp the situation without problems. The mentor could send appropriate instructions by voice, could point out a specific part by telestration function, and could draw lines on the 2-dimentional images pasted on the operator's field of vision.

DISCUSSION

With the use of HoloLens, Skype, and the 3-layer models, it was possible to demonstrate telementoring. The risk of personal information leakage due to data interception seems to be very low because its data communication is encrypted with advanced encryption standard.

CONCLUSION

This telementoring system has various advantages and many improvable aspects in the field of craniofacial surgery.},

The increasing image quality and speed might enable new fields of application where the volumetric OCT completely replaces stereoscopic microscopes instead of being a mere supplement. Aside from the depth resolving capability, a particular advantage is the ability to display a whole image volume from arbitrary points of view without the need to move the actual microscope or to rotate the patient's eye. Purely digital microscopy is already offered as alternative to traditional through-an-eyepiece surgical microscope. We explore the use of virtual reality to present digital OCT microscopy images to a trained surgeon, carrying out a series of surgical procedures ex-vivo on a porcine eye model.},

@article{Weyhe.2018,
 abstract = {We developed a prototype of a virtual, immersive, and interactive anatomy atlas for surgical anatomical training. The aim of this study was to test the usability of the VR anatomy atlas and to measure differences in knowledge acquirement between an immersive content delivery medium and conventional learning (OB). Twenty-eight students of the 11th grade of two german high schools randomly divided into two groups. One group used conventional anatomy books and charts whereas the other group used the VR Anatomy Atlas to answer nine anatomy questions. Error rate, duration for answering the individual questions, satisfaction with the teaching unit, and existence of a medical career wish were evaluated as a function of the learning method. The error rate was the same for both schools and between both teaching aids (VR: 34.2{\%}; OB: 34.1{\%}). The answering speed for correctly answered questions in the OB group was approx. twice as high as for the VR group (mean value OB: 98 s, range: 2-410 s; VR: 50 s, 1-290 s). There was a significant difference between the students of the two schools based on a longer processing time in the OB condition in School B (mean OB in School A: 158 s; OB in School B: 77 s). The subjective survey on the learning methods showed a significantly better satisfaction for VR (p = 0.012). Medical career aspirations have been strengthened with VR, while interest of the OB group in such a career tended to decline. The immersive anatomy atlas helped to actively and intuitively perform targeted actions that led to correct answers in a shorter amount of time, even without prior knowledge of VR and anatomy. With the OB method, orientation difficulties and/or the technical effort in the handling of the topographical anatomy atlas seem to lead to a significantly longer response time, especially if the students are not specially trained in literature research in books or texts. This seems to indicate that the VR environment in the sense of constructivist learning might be a more intuitive and effective way to acquire knowledge than from books.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Innovation in computer-assisted surgery (CAS) aims to increase operative accuracy and improve safety by decreasing procedure-related complications. The application of reality technologies, to CAS has begun to revolutionize orthopedic training and practice.

METHODS

For this review, relevant published reports were found via searches of Medline (PubMed) data base using the following medical subject headings (MeSH) terms: {\textquotedbl}virtual reality{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}augmented reality{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}mixed reality{\textquotedbl} with {\textquotedbl}orthopedics{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}orthopedic surgery{\textquotedbl} and all relevant reports we utilized.

RESULTS

Trainees now have authentic and highly interactive operative simulations without the need for supervision. The practicing orthopedic surgeon is better able to pre-operatively plan and intra-operatively navigate without the use of fluoroscopy, gain access to three-dimensional reconstructions of patient imaging, and remotely interact with colleagues located outside the operating room.

CONCLUSION

This review provides a current and comprehensive examination of the reality technologies and their applications in Orthopedic surgery.},

There have not been any reviews focussing on hip and knee orthopaedic simulators. A comparison of existing simulator features is provided to identify what is missing and what is required to improve upon current simulators. In total 11 hip replacements pre-operative planning tools were analysed, plus 9 hip trauma fracture training simulators. Additionally 9 knee arthroscopy simulators and 8 other orthopaedic simulators were included for comparison. The findings are that for orthopaedic surgery simulators in general, there is increasing use of patient-specific virtual models which reduce the learning curve. Modelling is also being used for patient-specific implant design and manufacture. Simulators are being increasingly validated for assessment as well as training. There are very few training simulators available for hip replacement, yet more advanced virtual reality is being used for other procedures such as hip trauma and drilling. Training simulators for hip replacement and orthopaedic surgery in general lag behind other surgical procedures for which virtual reality has become more common. Further developments are required to bring hip replacement training simulation up to date with other procedures. This suggests there is a gap in the market for a new high fidelity hip replacement and resurfacing training simulator.},

On the other hand, materials used for mimicking different living tissues are explored by focusing on the material properties: elastic modulus, hardness, etc. As a result, doctors can practice before performing surgery and thereby reduce the time needed for the operation. The subject of patient education is also introduced. A thorough review of the process that is required to obtain 3D printed surgical planning prototypes, which is based on different stages, is then carried out. Finally, the ethical issues associated with 3D printing in medicine are discussed, along with its future perspectives. Overall, this is important for improving the outcome of the surgery, since doctors will be able to visualize the affected organs and even to practice surgery before performing it.},

Three-dimensional (3D) analysis and planning are powerful tools in craniofacial and reconstructive surgery. The elements include 1) analysis, 2) planning, 3) virtual surgery, 4) 3D printouts of guides or implants, and 5) verification of actual to planned results. The purpose of this article is to review different applications of 3D planning in craniomaxillofacial surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Case examples involving 3D analysis and planning were reviewed. Common threads pertaining to all types of reconstruction are highlighted and contrasted with unique aspects specific to new applications in craniomaxillofacial surgery.

RESULTS

Six examples of 3D planning are described: 1) cranial reconstruction, 2) craniosynostosis, 3)~midface advancement, 4) mandibular distraction, 5) mandibular reconstruction, and 6) orthognathic surgery.

CONCLUSIONS

Planning in craniomaxillofacial surgery is useful and has applicability across different procedures and reconstructions. Three-dimensional planning and virtual surgery enhance efficiency, accuracy, creativity, and reproducibility in craniomaxillofacial surgery.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

The advantages of 3D reconstruction, immersive virtual reality (VR) and 3D printing in abdominal surgery have been enunciated for many years, but still today their application in routine clinical practice is almost nil. We investigate their feasibility, user appreciation and clinical impact.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Fifteen patients undergoing pancreatic, hepatic or renal surgery were studied realizing a 3D reconstruction of target anatomy. Then, an immersive VR environment was developed to import 3D models, and some details of the 3D scene were printed. All the phases of our workflow employed open-source software and low-cost hardware, easily implementable by other surgical services. A qualitative evaluation of the three approaches was performed by 20 surgeons, who filled in a specific questionnaire regarding a clinical case for each organ considered.

RESULTS

Preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative guidance was feasible for all patients included in the study. The vast majority of surgeons interviewed scored their quality and usefulness as very good.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite extra time, costs and efforts necessary to implement these systems, the benefits shown by the analysis of questionnaires recommend to invest more resources to train physicians to adopt these technologies routinely, even if further and larger studies are still mandatory.},

@article{Pulijala.2018,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

Surgical training methods are evolving with the technological advancements, including the application of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality. However, 28 to 40{\%} of novice residents are not confident in performing a major surgical procedure. VR surgery, an immersive VR (iVR) experience, was developed using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices (Leap Motion, Inc, San Francisco, CA) to address this challenge. Our iVR is a multisensory, holistic surgical training application that demonstrates a maxillofacial surgical technique, the Le Fort I osteotomy. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of using VR surgery on the self-confidence and knowledge of surgical residents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A multisite, single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed. The participants were novice surgical residents with limited experience in performing the Le Fort I osteotomy. The primary outcome measures were the self-assessment scores of trainee confidence using a Likert scale and an objective assessment of the cognitive skills. Ninety-five residents from 7 dental schools were included in the RCT. The participants were randomly divided into a study group of 51 residents and a control group of 44. Participants in the study group used the VR surgery application on an Oculus Rift with Leap Motion device. The control group participants used similar content in a standard PowerPoint presentation on a laptop. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was applied to the data to assess the overall effect of the intervention on the confidence of the residents.

RESULTS

The study group participants showed significantly greater perceived self-confidence levels compared with those in the control group (P~=~.034; \textgreek{a}~=~0.05). Novices in the first year of their training showed the greatest improvement in their confidence compared with those in their second and third year.

CONCLUSIONS

iVR experiences improve the knowledge and self-confidence of the surgical residents.},

 abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) surgery using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices is a multi-sensory, holistic surgical training experience. A multimedia combination including 360° videos, three-dimensional interaction, and stereoscopic videos in VR has been developed to enable trainees to experience a realistic surgery environment. The innovation allows trainees to interact with the individual components of the maxillofacial anatomy and apply surgical instruments while watching close-up stereoscopic three-dimensional videos of the surgery. In this study, a novel training tool for Le Fort I osteotomy based on immersive virtual reality (iVR) was developed and validated. Seven consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeons evaluated the application for face and content validity. Using a structured assessment process, the surgeons commented on the content of the developed training tool, its realism and usability, and the applicability of VR surgery for orthognathic surgical training. The results confirmed the clinical applicability of VR for delivering training in orthognathic surgery. Modifications were suggested to improve the user experience and interactions with the surgical instruments. This training tool is ready for testing with surgical trainees.},

 abstract = {Worldwide, more than 80{\%} of people with cancer will require surgery during their disease course, but less than 25{\%} have access to safe, affordable and timely surgery. Among the barriers to increasing surgical capacity are the time and costs required to train novices. Virtual reality (VR) surgical simulations can reduce the time required for novices to reach surgical proficiency, though their costs may exceed USD {\$}100,000. The goal of this study was to determine if a low-cost system, using commercially available technology designed for in-home computer gaming, could be used to create a realistic VR surgical oncology simulation. Standard commercially available VR software and Oculus Rift hardware have been used to provide high-quality visuals and believable surgeon hand interactions. Near identical VR reproduction of an operating room using 1:1 scale matching of real-world elements, including equipment, instruments, supplies and sounds, maintaining frame rate greater than 60 fps to maintain visual fidelity has been created. Internal anatomy was designed as VR replica of human female pelvic anatomy, including organs, veins and other vessels, peritoneum and connective tissue. Internal anatomy was designed to run at 120 fps and to allow for a realistic abdominal radical hysterectomy simulation. Surgical hands were modelled to scale for those with large and small hands. Multiple hand positions were simulated using Oculus touch hardware. Reconstructing the virtual environment to simulate reality as accurately as possible was done to immerse users in the simulator so that they focus on learning and practise without distractions. Training modules were co-designed by experts in learning sciences, human behaviour, VR and gynaecologic oncology. We have successfully created a low-cost VR simulation to help prepare novice surgeons to perform a radical abdominal hysterectomy surgery procedure. The simulation can be used with commercially available computer gaming hardware that currently costs less than USD {\$}1,500. Low-cost VR simulation has the potential to reduce the time and cost to train surgeons to perform surgical oncology procedures, as well as both improve and audit quality. If effective in real-world clinical trials, such simulations have relevance to multiple surgical procedures and applicability in both resource-limited and high-income settings.},

 abstract = {For daily burn wound care and therapeutic physical therapy skin stretching procedures, powerful pain medications alone are often inadequate. This feasibility study provides the first evidence that entering an immersive virtual environment using very inexpensive ($\sim${\$}400) wide field of view Oculus Rift Virtual Reality (VR) goggles can elicit a strong illusion of presence and reduce pain during VR. The patient was an 11-year-old male with severe electrical and flash burns on his head, shoulders, arms, and feet (36 percent total body surface area (TBSA), 27 percent TBSA were third-degree burns). He spent one 20-minute occupational therapy session with no VR, one with VR on day 2, and a final session with no VR on day 3. His rating of pain intensity during therapy dropped from severely painful during no VR to moderately painful during VR. Pain unpleasantness dropped from moderately unpleasant during no VR to mildly unpleasant during VR. He reported going {\textquotedbl}completely inside the computer generated world{\textquotedbl}, and had more fun during VR. Results are consistent with a growing literature showing reductions in pain during VR. Although case studies are scientifically inconclusive by nature, these preliminary results suggest that the Oculus Rift VR goggles merit more attention as a potential treatment for acute procedural pain of burn patients. Availability of inexpensive but highly immersive VR goggles would significantly improve cost effectiveness and increase dissemination of VR pain distraction, making VR available to many more patients, potentially even at home, for pain control as well as a wide range of other VR therapy applications. This is the first clinical data on PubMed to show the use of Oculus Rift for any medical application.},

 abstract = {Among the many areas which may benefit from virtual reality (VR), GI endoscopy could be an important one. We developed a system to magnify the endoscopic image on forward movement of the endoscopists head to zoom into areas of interest during real-time endoscopy, called intuitive zoom. We could show that VR could be conveniently incorporated into daily endoscopic work when it comes to closely examining operator-defined regions of interest. Additionally, applied light intensity-derived three-dimensional (3D)reconstruction of the intestinal mucosa was used to better assess lesions such as polyps using the Paris classification. These new techniques might improve routine endoscopic diagnosis and therapy and open a new world of endoscopic training.{\#}{\#}{\#} Study backgroundFlexible endoscopy is performed using a two-dimensional~(2D) image of the working area. Although this is regarded as a standard since 1970,1 new technologies allowing for stereoscopic vision thus improving visual spacial perception emerge. VR is used to generate realistic images that replicate a real environment by using head mounted displays (HMDs). Since 2016, after the introduction of the HMDs Oculus Rift (Oculus VR, California, USA) and HTC VIVE (HTC, New Taipei City, Republic of China), the technology became available at consumer prices. Until now, VR is often used for training purposes like surgical training.2 3 VR is also used for endoscopic training although most simulators just project a virtual endoscopic image on a flat screen without full immersion of the examiner.4--6 To explore the potential of VR in real-time flexible endoscopy, we developed a setup for performing endoscopic interventions aided by special features that can be easily implemented in VR.{\#}{\#}{\#} MethodsEndoscopic examinations were performed using an Olympus GIF-HQ190 and CF-HQ190I (Hamburg, Germany).

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the VR training tool on mental and physical workload in novice surgeons. The secondary objective included an evaluation of the VR simulator. METHODS A monocentric-controlled trial was conducted. Ten participants were divided into two groups, the VR group and the control group (without VR training). Surgery residents participated in a first real case of SPSG and a second case 1~month later. The VR group underwent a VR training between the two surgeries. Mental and physical loads were assessed with self-assessment questionnaires: NASA-TLX, Borg scale, and manikin discomfort test. The VR simulator was evaluated through presence, cybersickness, and usability questionnaires. RESULTS This study showed a decrease of the mental demand and effort dimensions of NASA-TLX between the first and the second surgery in the VR group (P {\textless} .05). During the second surgery, a marginally significant difference was shown concerning the mental demand between the two groups. Postural discomfort of the VR group decreased with practice (P {\textless} .01), mainly between the first and the second surgery (P {\textless} .05).

 abstract = {BACKGROUND Virtual reality is the science of creating a virtual environment for the assessment of various anatomical regions of the body for the diagnosis, planning and surgical training. Augmented reality is the superimposition of a 3D real environment specific to individual patient onto the surgical filed using semi-transparent glasses to augment the virtual scene.. The aim of this study is to provide an over view of the literature on the application of virtual and augmented reality in oral {\&} maxillofacial surgery. METHODS We reviewed the literature and the existing database using Ovid MEDLINE search, Cochran Library and PubMed. All the studies in the English literature in the last 10 years, from 2009 to 2019 were included. RESULTS We identified 101 articles related the broad application of virtual reality in oral {\&} maxillofacial surgery. These included the following: Eight systematic reviews, 4 expert reviews, 9 case reports, 5 retrospective surveys, 2 historical perspectives, 13 manuscripts on virtual education and training, 5 on haptic technology, 4 on augmented reality, 10 on image fusion, 41 articles on the prediction planning for orthognathic surgery and maxillofacial reconstruction. Dental implantology and orthognathic surgery are the most frequent applications of virtual reality and augmented reality. Virtual planning improved the accuracy of inserting dental implants using either a statistic guidance or dynamic navigation. In orthognathic surgery, prediction planning and intraoperative navigation are the main applications of virtual reality. Virtual reality has been utilised to improve the delivery of education and the quality of training in oral {\&} maxillofacial surgery by creating a virtual environment of the surgical procedure. Haptic feedback provided an additional immersive reality to improve manual dexterity and improve clinical training. CONCLUSION Virtual and augmented reality have contributed to the planning of maxillofacial procedures and surgery training. Few articles highlighted the importance of this technology in improving the quality of patients' care. There are limited prospective randomized studies comparing the impact of virtual reality with the standard methods in delivering oral surgery education.

@article{Frederiksen.2020,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Virtual reality simulators combined with head-mounted displays enable highly immersive virtual reality (VR) for surgical skills training, potentially bridging the gap between the simulation environment and real-life operating room conditions. However, the increased complexity of the learning situation in immersive VR could potentially induce high cognitive load thereby inhibiting performance and learning. This study aims to compare cognitive load and performance in immersive VR and conventional VR simulation training.

METHODS

A randomized controlled trial of residents (n = 31) performing laparoscopic salpingectomies with an ectopic pregnancy in either immersive VR or conventional VR simulation. Cognitive load was estimated by secondary-task reaction time at baseline, and during nonstressor and stressor phases of the procedure. Simulator metrics were used to evaluate performance.

RESULTS

Cognitive load was increased by 66{\%} and 58{\%} during immersive VR and conventional VR simulation, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001), compared to baseline. A light stressor induced a further increase in cognitive load by 15.2{\%} and a severe stressor by 43.1{\%} in the immersive VR group compared to 23{\%} (severe stressor) in the conventional VR group. Immersive VR also caused a significantly worse performance on most simulator metrics.

CONCLUSION

Immersive VR simulation training induces a higher cognitive load and results in a poorer performance than conventional VR simulation training in laparoscopy. High extraneous load and element interactivity in the immersive VR are suggested as mechanisms explaining this finding. However, immersive VR offers some potential advantages over conventional VR such as more real-life conditions but we only recommend introducing immersive VR in surgical skills training after initial training in conventional VR.},

@book{Farahani.2016,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Digital slides obtained from whole slide imaging (WSI) platforms are typically viewed in two dimensions using desktop personal computer monitors or more recently on mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any studies viewing digital pathology slides in a virtual reality (VR) environment. VR technology enables users to be artificially immersed in and interact with a computer-simulated world. Oculus Rift is among the world's first consumer-targeted VR headsets, intended primarily for enhanced gaming. Our aim was to explore the use of the Oculus Rift for examining digital pathology slides in a VR environment.

METHODS

An Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2) was connected to a 64-bit computer running Virtual Desktop software. Glass slides from twenty randomly selected lymph node cases (ten with benign and ten malignant diagnoses) were digitized using a WSI scanner. Three pathologists reviewed these digital slides on a 27-inch 5K display and with the Oculus Rift after a 2-week washout period. Recorded endpoints included concordance of final diagnoses and time required to examine slides. The pathologists also rated their ease of navigation, image quality, and diagnostic confidence for both modalities.

RESULTS

There was 90{\%} diagnostic concordance when reviewing WSI using a 5K display and Oculus Rift. The time required to examine digital pathology slides on the 5K display averaged 39 s (range 10-120 s), compared to 62 s with the Oculus Rift (range 15-270 s). All pathologists confirmed that digital pathology slides were easily viewable in a VR environment. The ratings for image quality and diagnostic confidence were higher when using the 5K display.

CONCLUSION

Using the Oculus Rift DK2 to view and navigate pathology whole slide images in a virtual environment is feasible for diagnostic purposes. However, image resolution using the Oculus Rift device was limited. Interactive VR technologies such as the Oculus Rift are novel tools that may be of use in digital pathology.},

@article{Eijlers.2017,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Preoperative anxiety in children is highly prevalent and is associated with adverse outcomes. Existing psychosocial interventions to reduce preoperative anxiety are often aimed at distraction and are of limited efficacy. Gradual exposure is a far more effective way to reduce anxiety. Virtual reality (VR) provides a unique opportunity to gradually expose children to all aspects of the operating theater.

OBJECTIVE

The aims of our study are (1) to develop a virtual reality exposure (VRE) tool to prepare children psychologically for surgery; and (2) to examine the efficacy of the VRE tool in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), in which VRE will be compared to care as usual (CAU).

METHODS

The VRE tool is highly realistic and resembles the operating room environment accurately. With this tool, children will not only be able to explore the operating room environment, but also get accustomed to general anesthesia procedures. The PREoperative Virtual reality Intervention to Enhance Wellbeing (PREVIEW) study will be conducted. In this single-blinded RCT, 200 consecutive patients (aged 4 to 12 years) undergoing elective day care surgery for dental, oral, or ear-nose-throat problems, will be randomly allocated to the preoperative VRE intervention or CAU. The primary outcome is change in child state anxiety level between baseline and induction of anesthesia. Secondary outcome measures include child's postoperative anxiety, emergence delirium, postoperative pain, use of analgesics, health care use, and pre- and postoperative parental anxiety.

RESULTS

The VRE tool has been developed. Participant recruitment began March 2017 and is expected to be completed by September 2018.

CONCLUSIONS

To our knowledge, this is the first RCT evaluating the effect of a VRE tool to prepare children for surgery. The VRE intervention is expected to significantly diminish preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, and the use of postoperative analgesics in pediatric patients. The tool could create a less stressful experience for both children and their parents, in line with the modern emphasis on patient- and family-centered care.
