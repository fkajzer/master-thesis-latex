To perform procedures, a project case has to be loaded first.
Each procedure will add a step to the project case.
For each procedure, there is an 'indicate' action when the user touches the trigger button, as well as an 'perform' action when the user presses the button.
This way, the user can touch the trigger button when he is about to perform a procedure and has visual feedback of when and where the procedure will start (i.e. tip of the surgical instrument).
Each time a procedure is performed, the user gets voice feedback that a step has been added.
The user can also navigate the steps by using voice commands, so that navigation thorugh the steps of the whole procedure can be done while holding surgical instruments.
At this point, six procedures are implemented in the system.
However, as described in Section \ref{sec::Architecture}, the system is extensible in the regard that new instruments can be implemented.
Currently, the implemented instruments are based on the workflow of OMF surgeons of the UHA: Users can perform drilling, hammer and chisel, bonesaw and milling operations.
Additionally, users can place markings and osteosynthesis plates on the virtual patient.
For some of the surgical instruments implemented, the user representation of the hand will be shown, for other not.
When a surgical instrument has this feature implemented, it is guaranteed that the instrument will always be grabbed and positioned as planned.
When this feature is missing, the user will not see his virtual hands on the surgical instrument, but can chose to hold it however he wants.
The decision, on which was decided if a surgical instrument should have this feature implemented, was made by a trial and error approach in which was investigated whether this feature was helpful or frustrating.
