\end{figure}

The milling operation is triggered by holding down the trigger button.
While the button is being held down, shapes are being drawn at the tip of the instrument \ref{fig::FeaturePiezo}.
When the button is released, the shapes are combined into a single 3D model and added as a project step.
The procedure which has been performed can this way be reconstructed by "milling" the same 3D space in the virtual operating room.
