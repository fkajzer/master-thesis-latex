After the thorough requirement analysis in Section \ref{sec::RequirementAnalysis} based on which a concept for the software was derived in Section \ref{sec::Concept}, 
the following section will focus on the implementation of the system components, starting with architectural components as well as utilities provided by SteamVR.
The virtual OT and the design process will then be shortly described.
Afterwards, available user interactions and the concrete implementation details of surgical procedures and visualization tools will be discussed.
Lastly, the work- and interaction flow of the system will be described.
