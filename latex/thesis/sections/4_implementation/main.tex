After the thorough requirement analysis in Section \ref{sec::RequirementAnalysis} on which a concept for the software was derived in \ref{sec::Concept}, 
we can now discuss the implementation of the system components.
We will start with the work- and interaction flow of the system.
Afterwards, we will shortly discuss architectural components as well as utilities provided by SteamVR.
Later, available commands and the concrete implementation details of surgical procedures and visualization tools will be discussed.
