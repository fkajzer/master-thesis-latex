After the implementation has been completed, it is necessary to assess the usability of the prototype.
For the purpose of the evaluation, five surgical trainees from the
OMFS department of UHA were asked to perform the planning of procedures 
in three distinct project cases, which included different patient models 
and findings.
\\ In the following section, the design and conduct of the study will be described in detail.
Afterwards, the results of the evaluation will be discussed.
