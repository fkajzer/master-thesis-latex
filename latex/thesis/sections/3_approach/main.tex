As this thesis is a completely new project, a new architecture build from the ground up is needed.
Since the main focus of this thesis is visualisation and planning for OMFS with HMDs, the aim is to provide an immersive planning and training tool using consumer hardware.
This means that while the main goal is surgery simulation, the focus is not on realistic physical behaviour of tissue.
