The related works highlight the importance of presence for training simulations.
A combined approach of clincal examination together with 3D inspection of the patient has an unprecedented potential toward the diagnosis of patients with maxillofacial deformities \cite{swennen2009three} by providing a virtual inspection of the patientâ€™s anatomy.
This is precisely why this thesis proposes a novel approach to existing methods.
Since commercially available hardware today is able to produce high fidelity visuals and an immersive, stereoscopic view of virtual objects,
the natural conclusion is to try out innovative approaches to existing problems with them.
The related works also highlight the importance of visualization tools in such applications, since they were universally well received. 
Additionally, not only the surgical environment, but also the interactions, usability and the user representation in the VR have to be considered.

Based on the related work described in Section \ref{chap::RelatedWork} and the goal of the thesis outlined in Section \ref{chap::Introduction}, a requirement analysis has been conducted.
The requirement analysis is divided in non-functional and functional requirements.
Afterwards, a concept is then finalized and described.
