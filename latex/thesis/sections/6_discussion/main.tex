By simply adding the planned procedures as additional 3D-Data to the patient as described in Section \ref{sec::Workflow}, we ensure extensibility and robustness of the software.
The tradeoff however, is that we can not adjust the procedures "on the fly" via text, but procedures have to be adjusted from within a 3D-modeling software or directly in the VR-application.
