AKTUELL: SAMMLUNG VON PUNKTEN

-By simply adding the planned procedures as additional 3D-Data to the patient as described in Section \ref{sec::Workflow}, extensibility and robustness of the software is ensured.
The tradeoff however, is that the procedures cannot be adjusted "on the fly" via text, but procedures have to be adjusted from within a 3D-modeling software or directly in the VR-application.

- Users performing the medical imaging acquisition have to make expert decisions about which techniques to use to highlight the patient specific tissue.

- The thought process behind this (step instructions manuell eintragen )decision is that only medical experts themselves can know about the fine details while performing certain procedures.
Thus it is simply necessary to manually edit them with expert knowledge.

- When trying out the different apporaches as depicted in Setion \ref{sec::Workflow}, findings were that using this kind of approach is best suited for extensibility reasons. (TODO DISCUSSION?)
