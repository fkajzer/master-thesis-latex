Through today's well established field of medical imaging, surgeons can get a very detailed view of patientâ€™s specific anatomy and pathology. 
It is an essential part of preparing for surgery \cite{Steinbacher.2015}.
Most commonly used medical imaging modalities (not exlusive) are computed tomography (CT), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
CT makes use of x-ray measurements from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) "slices" of the scanned site \cite{Handels.2009}.
With this technique, bone structure and soft tissue can be displayed in medical imaging.
The disadvantage of these techniques is the exposure to carcinogenic x-rays.
\\
In MRI, strong magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients are used to create tomography of the patients tissue \cite{Handels.2009}.
Since this technique makes use of hydrogen atoms, which are predominantly present in patient's soft tissue, bone structure is not imaged well.
When studying mandibular joints for example, MRI is able to outperform CT \cite{RN65}.
\\
The most recent one, CBCT, lowers radiation dosage of traditional CT and continually contributes to the accuracy of diagnostic tasks of the viscerocranium \cite{Vos.2009}.
CBCT excels in imaging of bone tissue, while other tissues are not imaged well \cite{Vos.2009}.
It is able to produce images with isotropic submillimeter spatial resolution, which is ideally suited for isolated viscerocranium scans. 
The radiation dosage of CBCT is less than traditional CT and thus helps optimize health-to-risk ratio \cite{WHITE2008689}.

As discussed, there are a variety of ways to acquire medical imaging.
However, the displaying methods of 3D medical imaging data is very limited for surgeons.
After acquiring raw data via aformentioned modalities, volume images are generated in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format \cite{DICOMStandard}.
DICOM is the standard format for the storage of volumetric image data.
Generally, data is reconstructed in three planes (axial, sagittal and coronal).
Each plane is represented in "slices" of varying thickness, which are represented as volumetric voxels.
The resulting voxels are then displayed as pixels on monitors.
The voxels resolution is described in the \textit{SpacingBetweenImages} and \textit{SliceThickness} attributes of the slices in the DICOM standard \cite{DICOMStandard}.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a very diverse surgical discipline.
It has to handle an arrangement of bones, teeth, vessels, cartilage, nerves, muscles, skin and gland tissue.
These structures can be deeply complex, even more so in the viscerocranium.
Therefore, OMF surgeons rely on accurate 3D medical imaging to plan procedures \cite{Fonseca.2018}.
Even though three-dimensional objects are being analysed and also generated, they are viewed in a two-dimensional format on conventional computer screens \cite{brewster1984interactive}.
The generated slices from medical imaging are viewed in the mentioned planes to get volumentric understanding of patient's underlying anatomy and pathology.
The challenge with raw DICOM images is that they are generally unsegmented and it is up to the viewer of the medical imaging to interpret them correctly \cite{Handels.2009}.

The first virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) was described in the scientific literature by Ivan Sutherland in 1968 \cite{sutherland1968head}.
Since then, they have become more and more relevant and increasingly popular in various fields of research.
\\
The first medical application of VR (without HMD) goes back to 1965, where R. Mann et al. evaluated the use of VR as a mobility aid for the blind 
by creating a virtual environment in which to test an hypothetical auditory display device \cite{mann1965evaluation}.
In general, VR in medicine can be split into generic models and patient specific models.
Generic models are based on non-specific "average" data \cite{486713}.
Patient specific models on the other hand are created for each individual patients.
Throughout the years, a number of such "virtual human" applications have been developed and had left positive impressions \cite{486713}.

Data fusion is the term used to address the capability of a system to integrate data from different sources.
In the past decade, imaging techniques became very powerful and provided high resolution data \cite{RN2}.
However, the surgeon must still be able to run 2D images delivered by techniques such as MRI or CT in front of his mental eyes to build a 3D model of the structures \cite{Fonseca.2018}.
Many of these images show the region of interest (ROI) from different perspectives than the surgeons will view it during the operation.
The surgeon not only has to create a mental 3D model, but must also be able to fit the orientation of that model onto the observed structures during the operation.
Creation of 3D models using existing data from MRI or CT is easily done by the computer, allowing the surgeon to concentrate on more complex tasks \cite{486713}.

VR promises major improvements in this area.
Through the stereoscopic vision of VR, surgeons can get a more natural and realistic feeling environment for education and training purposes.
This can be achieved either by room-mounted displays or HMDs, however, consumer HMDs are especially affordable.

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. 
In Section \ref{chap::RelatedWork} related research in the field of VR applied to surgical workflows and existing surgical simulations will be presented.
Used hard- and software, as well as input devices (with and without haptic feedback) will be presented.
A number of surgical simulations which utilized HMDs will be described in detail.
Different visualization techniques and levels of presence will also be presented via the related work.
In Section \ref{chap::Approach}, the developed requirements from the aforementioned related works, which are used as a guideline to design the system, will be described 
together with a broad concept of the software.
