As VR technology advances and entry costs are reduced, VR is considered more and more for a wide spectrum of applications \cite{Ayoub.2019, Berni.2020}.
However, VR was already considered as an important addition to surgical training over 10 years ago, with a prediction for even more relevance in the future \cite{RN60}.
In training and planning for surgery, the main focus of research is on surgical training with pre-modeled patient anatomy and pathology.

By using medical imaging in combination with VR, advances in medical visualization and surgery planning have already been achieved, which will be outlined in this section.
With the use of room-mounted displays, advantages of VR for the medical application have already been shown.
By using HMDs, costs can be reduced and integration into clinical routines is easier.
VR applications for surgery are distinguishable by their used display device, the kind of interaction, i.e. input device and the used development platform \cite{Vaughan.2016}.
