As VR technology advances and entry costs are reduced, VR is considered more and more for a wide spectrum of applications \cite{Ayoub.2019, Berni.2020}.
\newline
However, VR was already considered over 10 years ago as an important addition to surgical training, with a prediction for even more relevance in the future.
Low cost VR applications could be especially considered for resource-challenged countries where there is a lack of skilled workforce, mainly because of cost \cite{RN60}.
\newline
In surgery, the main focus of research is on surgical training with pre-modeled patient anatomy and pathology.
By using medical imaging and VR HMDs, advances in medical visualisation and surgery planning for patient specific procedures have been achieved, which will be outlined in this section.
VR HMD applications for surgery are distinguishable by their used VR HMD, the kind of interaciton i.e. input device and the used development platform.
