In the scientific literature about VR surgery applications, the level of presence which is aimed to achieve varies a lot.
Some do not pay any attention to immerse users into VR at all, i.e. they simply show a 3D model of the patients anatomy and 
pathalogy, while others make great efforts to completely immerse users into the VR \cite{Vaughan.2016}.
In some cases, VR is used solely as a novel visualization tool with novel control schemes \cite{.2017}.
However, other works make a great effort to give the user a level of presence, through modeling a virtual OT after real life locations as close as possible.
It was shown, that a higher level of presence can reduce stress and anxiety from real operations through VR training \cite{Pulijala.2017,Pulijala.2018,Pulijala.2018b}.
\\ In general, one of two approaches is utilized.
The first kind of approach is already depicted in Section \ref{sec::VRBasedApplications}.
Here applications make a great effort to simulate all aspects of the surgical environment, including patient, procedures with their respective instruments, and the virtual OT.
\\ This way, trainees feel present in the OT and focus on performing a surgical procedure.
In the other approach, which will be presented in the following, only some aspects of the surgical setting are present in the virtual OT.
360-degree video is used complimentary to VR to give stereoscopic instructional videos of certain procedures, while trainees have the option to pause video 
and visualize the patients anatomy via a 3D model of the patient.

Pulijala et al. \cite{Pulijala.2017} present a novel visualization and training tool for trainees as well as senior surgeons.
An immersive learning experience for surgical trainees through pre-recorded stereoscopic 3D videos of surgery and interactive models of patientâ€™s anatomy was created \cite{Pulijala.2017}.
The depicted surgical procedure was "Le Fort 1" surgery, a type of maxillofacial surgery, performed to correct lower midface deformities \cite{Pulijala.2017}
\\ 3D videos are used to provide depth perception and realistic view of the surgical procedure, with other surgeons performing the procedure.
This gives trainees the impression to be present during real procedures.
It was found that such realistic scenarios improved learning.
Users can zoom in and touch the 3D model of the patient's anatomy to visualise spatial relationships between the anatomy.
Trainees get feedback through questions and tasks about procedures \cite{Pulijala.2017,Pulijala.2018}.

Parham et al. \cite{Parham.2019} used an approach in which filmed procedures in 360-degree are utilized together with an immersive virtual OT.
The immersive virtual OT was already described in detail in Section \ref{sec::VRBasedApplications}. Here, the focus will be on the utilization of immersive 
video for training purposes.
\\ Videos of surgical procedures were captured during real surgical procedures using six specially arranged GoPro 360-degree cameras and were used to caputure the OT.
Additionally, close-ups of the surgical procedures were captured with stereoscopic 3D cameras \cite{Parham.2019}.
Captured videos were then played inside of the virtual OT during the training of the procedure.
The training consisted of online didactic lectures, readings and seven modules, with embedded videos that correspond to the surgical procedure.
These could be viewed from withing the virtual OT, so that trainees would watch procedures and then simulate them via the tools present in the OT \cite{Parham.2019}.

Barber et al. \cite{Barber.2020} propose a fusion of 3D-intraoperative 
video with immersive VR as a teaching tool for lateral skull base surgery.
Interactive anatomic models are utilized in an virtual OT while watching 
360-degree video as a learning tool.
This VR simluation situates users in the lead surgeon's chair while 
simultaneously being able to pause, stop and rewind the procedure.
Additionally, users have the 3D interactive anatomic model in their 
hands to utilize stereoscopic visualization of the surgical 
site. A user study to validate the 
methology was not conducted \cite{Barber.2020}.
