\textbf{Surgical Procedures}: Pulijala et al (2017) presented a novel visualization and training tool for trainees as well as senior surgeons.
An immersive learning experience for surgical trainees through pre-recorded stereoscopic 3D videos of surgery and interactive models of patientâ€™s anatomy was created \cite{Pulijala.2017}.
The depicted surgical procedure was "Le Fort 1" surgery, a type of maxillofacial surgery, performed to correct lower midface deformities \cite{Pulijala.2017}

Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy has been successfully simulated by utilizing VR together with haptic feedback devices \cite{VenkataS.Arikatla.2018}.
The haptic feedback device was used to perform procedure specific sawing and bone drilling operations.
