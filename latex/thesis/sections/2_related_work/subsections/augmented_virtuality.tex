\textbf{Augmented Virtuality}: Augmented virtuality is when the real world is "augmented" using virtual reality \cite{Milgram.1994}.
Immersive VR HMDs in combination with 3D printed models are being considered \cite{.2017,Sampogna.2017,Barber.2018}.
Models are printed at 1:1 scale for visualization, and additionally imported into the VR to make us of VRs interactive features \cite{.2017}.

Venkata et al (2018) have created a surgical simulator with tissue simulation of the bony structures of patients \cite{VenkataS.Arikatla.2018}.
An oscillating saw and a burr tool were successfully simulated with the use of HMDs and haptic feedback device for force feedback during BSSO.
